I'm Sarfraz Arshad, an entrepreneur with a passion for coding, data science, AI and a deep interest in the world of finance and investing. Over the years, I've explored various investment strategies, but one that has always resonated with me is value investingâ€”a philosophy championed by legendary investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett.
